## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This Angular project integrates with the Tracking More API to provide comprehensive shipment tracking functionality for Parisaline Clear Aligners, a dental project. The application allows users to monitor their orders by displaying key shipment milestones, including the shipped date, in transit date, out for delivery date, and delivered date. It provides real-time updates on the status of each shipment, indicating whether it is currently in the shipping process or has been delivered. By leveraging this detailed tracking information, the project ensures that users can easily follow their orders' progress and stay informed throughout the delivery journey.
